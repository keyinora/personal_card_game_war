# Card Game Engine: War

## Cards -> class

- number value
- suit (spades, clubs, hearts, diamonds)

## Deck -> class

- holds the cards

## Two Players

- hold cards -> array/list
- take turn putting top card in the middle to compare -> if statement
  1. if player 1 card is higher, player 1 gets card
  2. else if player 2 card is higher, player 2 gets card
  3. else, in the event of a tie, go to war
  4. logic for war (3 cards face down, compare the 4th cards with if statement) - Review this part as it doesn't make much sense

  5. what happens with cards that are won? bottom of array (cards in hand)? or in another array, then when no more cards in hand, shuffle and add to hand?

- Shuffle cards -> well they're in an array, so randomly sort
